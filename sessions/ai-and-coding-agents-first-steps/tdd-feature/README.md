# TDD with the Agent

(difficulty: 🔥🔥)

Bookshelf works and has tests. Your job is to add two features **test first**: you decide what the code should do and let the agent write the tests before it writes any code.

## The features

### 1. `sortBooks` in `src/books.ts`

```ts
sortBooks(books: Book[], key: "title" | "author" | "rating", direction?: "asc" | "desc"): Book[]
```

- The default direction is `"asc"`.
- It returns a **new** array and does not change the original.
- `"title"` and `"author"` sort alphabetically, **regardless of upper and lower case** (`"apple"` comes before `"Banana"`).
- `"rating"` sorts by the number of stars. **Books without a rating (0) always come last**, in both directions.
- Books that are equal keep their original order.

### 2. `ReadingProgress` in `src/components/ReadingProgress`

A component with the prop `books` that shows one line of text:

- without books: `No books yet.`
- otherwise: `<read> of <total> books read (<percent> %)`, for example `3 of 5 books read (60 %)`
- with exactly one book, it says `book` instead of `books`
- the percent value is rounded to a whole number (`1 of 3` is `33 %`)

## Tasks

Work in a git repository (`git init -b main`, `git add .`, `git commit -m "Initial commit"`). Use Claude Code in the **Manual mode** and keep your permission log (see the Bug Hunt challenge for the table).

1. Ask the agent to write the tests for `sortBooks` **from the specification above, without implementing anything**. Read every test. Does it check what the specification says? Is an edge case missing (empty list, unrated books in `"desc"`, equal books)? Ask for more tests.
2. Run `npm run test:run`. The new tests must be **red**, and red for the right reason ("sortBooks is not a function" is not a good reason, a failing assertion is). Commit the tests.
3. Ask the agent to implement `sortBooks` until the tests are green. Check `git diff`: did it change a test?
4. **Check the tests:** break the implementation on purpose (for example let `"rating"` ignore the unrated books). Does a test turn red? If not, the tests are not good enough.
5. Repeat steps 1 to 4 for `ReadingProgress`.
6. Wire both features into `App.tsx`: a select "Sort by" and the `ReadingProgress` line. Add a test for the sort select.
7. Run `npm run check` and `npm run test:run`, then look at the app in the browser.

### Questions for the end

- When did the agent write a test that only repeated its own implementation?
- Which edge cases did you have to ask for?
- Was it faster than writing the tests yourself? Was it better?

## Development

Install the dependencies with `npm i` first (Node.js 22.22 or newer is required).

- `npm run dev` starts the app in the browser
- `npm run test` runs the tests in the watch mode, `npm run test:run` runs them once
- `npm run check` checks the types
