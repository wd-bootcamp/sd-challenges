// TODO: Replace CartItem and ShippingEstimate with vi.mock.
//
// - ShippingEstimate uses fetch. In these tests it must not send a request.
// - The mocked CartItem (its props are typed with CartItemProps from "../CartItem") should render the item name and two buttons that call
//   onQuantityChange?.(item.id, 3) and onRemove?.(item.id). Then the tests can trigger the handlers
//   without knowing how the real CartItem looks like.
// - Wrap the mock components in vi.fn() so you can look at the props they received
//   (vi.mocked(CartItem).mock.calls).
